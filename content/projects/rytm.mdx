**Real YT Music** is an Android application to facilitate viewing and listening to videos on YouTube. The app was implemented using the YouTube API, it allows you to listen to videos while browsing and there are no advertisements.

To avoid violating the API owner's policies, it was not possible to implement the playback functionality with the screen off.

 App available only for Android, below is the link to the Google Play Store.
