The application is a project born out of a passion for movies at the cinema and an interest in meeting new people.
The goal is to find company to see movies at the cinema when you are alone but would like to share the experience.
The application includes a map with all the theaters created globally and, thanks to geographic location, you can see available theaters nearby.
The application includes a chat for organizing with other group members.
I personally worked on building the front-end in Flutter and the back-end, including the database.
Last but not least is the talk of privacy policy and terms and conditions of use, written as transparently as possible to highlight the good intentions with which I collect and maintain data.
